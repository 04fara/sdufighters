# SDU Fighters 2.0 (developing)

SDU (Suleyman Demirel University) Fighters is an analog to the well-known Mortal Kombat, and made as a course work, written in Java.

Initial idea was to make the places on the territory of SDU as the arena backgrounds, and some of the students to be used as the sprites of fighters, and so on, but the time we had was not enough to make our own sprites and some special abilities. That's why there are only two color variants of Sektor's sprite found in the Web, and the player can only move, jump, kick and punch.

I have just started re-creating it from scratch, there's still work to be done.
